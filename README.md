# Flappy Bird CS115
 
Part 1.
As a team, we will sketch out the game's core functions and what it will look like. 
The minimum requirements for the game will be that it loops indefinitely, obstacles appear from the right in random positions on the screen, a counter is displayed and points are added when obstacles are passed, and the game ends when your character touches an obstacle.
Some things that can be added are a timer for how long you have played, an option to upload a custom character or background, sound effects when the character moves or when an object is touched, a menu dashboard that displays the recent scores and highlights the top score, and different levels with different speeds at which the character moves.
Part 2.
As a team, we will delegate responsibilities so the project will go by faster. 
We will have weekly scrum calls and split the project into weekly sprints that are to be completed before the week’s scrum call. 
We will utilize GitHub and create a repository where we can collaborate and push changes only when the whole team approves. 
Alongside the programming will be documenting anything of significance on the presentation slide. 
We will document what we learned, the challenges we faced, and the things we didn’t understand how they worked.
Part 3.
Some challenges may include learning how to create an animation window, how to display image files/play sound files, and randomizing the position of the obstacles. This project involves a lot of research into Java’s libraries and included functions.
Part 4.
The deliverables are a desktop application as well as a slide presentation. The minimum we expect to deliver is an infinitely running game with randomized obstacles that displays and continuously updates the score and ends when an obstacle is touched. The expected timeframe of
